		<h1>OcramTower "Game"</h1>
		<p>This is the home page linking to the various versions of OcramTower.
			OcramTower is a spinoff of OpenTower, an open-source SimTower clone.
			While OpenTower was written in C++, OcramTower is an online game utilizing
			HTML5, JavaScript, XML, and CSS.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>As of June 22nd, the latest version of the game draws a static image of the tower.</p>

		<br/>
		<a href="OcramTower-prealpha4.html">Here is the version of the game completed on November 26th, 2014. It is still a work-in-progress</a> 
		<br/>
		<a href="OcramTower-RoomInfo.html">Here is an incomplete list of the rooms (and their information) last updated on November 26th, 2014.</a>

		<p>I had high hopes for OpenTower and I made a video demonstrating what I wanted to achieve. The video is rather short because
			it was rather labour intensive to make in Gimp.</p>
