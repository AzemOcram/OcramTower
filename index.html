 <h1>OcramTower "Game"</h1>
 <p>This is the home page linking to the various versions of OcramTower.
 OcramTower is a spinoff of OpenTower, an open-source SimTower clone.
 While OpenTower was written in C++, OcramTower is an online game utilizing
 HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS.</p>
 <br/>
 <p>As of June 22nd, the latest version of the game draws a static image of the tower.</p>
 <a href="OcramTower-prealpha3.html">Here is the version of the game completed on June 14th, 2014.</a> 
 <br/>
 <p>I had high hopes for OpenTower and I made a video demonstrating what I wanted to achieve. The video is rather short because
 it was rather labour intensive to make in Gimp.</p>
