<h1>First Experiment with Multiple Canvases for OcramTower</h1>
<p>The first canvas should eventually display a small (clipped) portion of the scene below. Currently, it only displays a square in the corner with a gradient.
The second canvas should have the background of the scene. 
The third canvas should have the tower and its rooms.
The fourth canvas should eventually have the transportation (stairs, elevators, escalators) and agents. It currently has only a small square with a gradient.</p>
