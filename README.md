OcramTower
==========

Web based game meant to be a spiritual successor to SimTower and Yoot Tower

This game currently has no gameplay or functionality besides displaying a tower that has already been made.
Future revisions will allow the player to build a tower from the ground up.

The main page was OcramTower-prealpha1.html and it might take a while to load. I recommend you open it in a private tab
or in Internet Explorer 10+. OcramTower-prealpha3.html should load just fine.
